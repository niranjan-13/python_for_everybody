Intellectual property law protects the results of human creative endeavor. Intel-
law law the the the human four four four four four law and and and and and to 
lectual property is generally thought to comprise four separate fields of law:
­trademarks, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets. A trademark is a word, name,
symbol, or device used to identify and distinguish one’s goods or services and to
­indicate their source. Rights in trademarks are created by use of a mark; registration
law law the the the human four four four four four law and and and and and to 
with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is not required, although it of-
fers certain advantages. Copyright protects original works of authorship, ­including
literary, musical, dramatic, artistic, and other works. Just as trademarks are pro-
tected from the moment of their first public use, copyright exists from the moment
of creation of a work in fixed form; registration of a copyright with the U.S. Copy-
right Office, while affording certain benefits, is not required. A patent is a grant
law law the the the human four four four four four law and and and and and to 
from the U.S. government that permits its owner to exclude others from making,
selling, using, or importing an invention. Patents exist only upon issuance by the
USPTO. A trade secret consists of any valuable commercial information that, if
known by a competitor, would provide some benefit or advantage to the competi-
tor. No registration or other formalities are required to create a trade secret, and
trade secrets endure as long as reasonable efforts are made to protect their secrecy.
